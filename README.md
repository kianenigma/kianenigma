/ A morgue is a morgue is a morgue. They  \
| can paint the walls with aggressively   |
| cheerful primary colors and splashy     |
| bold graphics, but it's still a holding |
| place for the dead until they can be    |
| parted out to organ banks. Not that I   |
| would have cared normally but my        |
| viewpoint was skewed. The relentless    |
| pleasance of the room I sat in seemed   |
| only grotesque.                         |
|                                         |
