/ There are three infallible ways of      \
| pleasing an author, and the three form  |
| a rising scale of compliment: 1, to     |
| tell him you have read one of his       |
| books; 2, to tell him you have read all |
| of his books; 3, to ask him to let you  |
| read the manuscript of his forthcoming  |
| book. No. 1 admits you to his respect;  |
| No. 2 admits you to his admiration; No. |
| 3 carries you clear into his heart.     |
