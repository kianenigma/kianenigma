/ Q: How many journalists does it take to \
| screw in a light bulb? A: Three. One to |
| report it as an inspired government     |
| program to bring                        |
|                                         |
| light to the people, one to report it   |
| as a diabolical government plot         |
|                                         |
| to deprive the poor of darkness, and    |
| one to win a Pulitzer prize for         |
|                                         |
| reporting that Electric Company hired a |
| light bulb-assassin to break            |
|                                         |
\ the bulb in the first place.            /
